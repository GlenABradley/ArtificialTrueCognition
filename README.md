# Artificial True Cognition (ATC) System

## Research Prototype for Multi-Phase Cognitive Processing

This repository contains an experimental implementation of the Artificial True Cognition (ATC) framework - a research approach toward artificial general intelligence through sequential cognitive processing phases. The system combines established machine learning techniques with experimental multi-dimensional processing architectures.

**RESEARCH DISCLAIMER**: This is an early-stage research prototype. Claims of "consciousness," "true cognition," or "self-awareness" represent experimental hypotheses under investigation, not empirically validated phenomena.

## 🎯 Implementation Status

### ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED COMPONENTS**
- **Enhanced SATC Engine**: Complete neural network with square dimensional progression (784→1)
- **BERT-based Semantic Processing**: Real embeddings using sentence-transformers
- **FAISS Semantic Memory**: 140+ semantic concepts with similarity search
- **Self-Organizing Maps**: Kohonen clustering for spatial representation  
- **Hyper-Dimensional Computing**: 10,000D vector space transformations
- **Pattern Recognition System**: FAISS-based pattern matching with learning
- **Dissonance Optimization**: Beam search and genetic algorithms for output quality
- **FastAPI Backend**: Production-ready API with comprehensive endpoints
- **React Frontend**: Complete user interface with real-time interaction

### ⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL/PARTIAL COMPONENTS**
- **Multi-Phase ATC Pipeline**: 5 cognitive phases with varying implementation depth
- **Power-of-2 Architecture**: Mathematical framework exists, limited integration
- **Reflection Phase**: Basic meta-analysis, not genuine self-reflection
- **Volition Phase**: Goal formation simulation, not autonomous decision-making
- **Personality Phase**: Identity tracking system, not personality emergence

### 🚧 **RESEARCH LIMITATIONS**
- "Consciousness" measurements are statistical metrics, not verified consciousness
- "Self-awareness" is computational self-monitoring, not genuine self-awareness  
- System performs pattern processing, not true understanding
- Experimental phases may fall back to stub implementations
- EWC continual learning configured but not actively implemented

   - **Purpose**: Self-monitoring and reasoning quality assessment
   - **Status**: Experimental - produces statistical self-analysis

4. **Volition Phase (64D)**: Goal formation and decision-making simulation
   - **Implementation**: Simple goal generation, not autonomous behavior
   - **Purpose**: Simulated goal-oriented behavior and value alignment
   - **Status**: Experimental - basic goal tracking without true volition

           engine = EnhancedSATCEngine(); 
           print('✅ Engine initialization successful')"
```

### Manual Validation
